# TithiApp 
One app for your Sanatan way of life!  

## Ideas for showing details on default screen/page
* Show sun/moon and different aspects (waxing and waning shapes) of it. Something as shown here - https://www.bbc.com/weather/2950159
* (Priority 2) Show temperature at the moment
* Some way to show the gradual transition to next Tithi which also captures after how long the transition will happen.
* Support for Native language by default. And change the language on the fly
* Relative position of SUN, MOON and EARTH ?
* (Priority 3) Ayurveda
* Different festivals
* (Priority 2) Different fasts
